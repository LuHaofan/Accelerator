abstract = {WiFi-based backscatter systems provide the potential to deliver battery-free sensors (tags) which can transmit data using a WiFi network. Existing backscatter systems have several problems which make them impractical to deploy and operate using existing WiFi networks. First, they require software or hardware modifications to WiFi access points and devices. Second, they do not work with WiFi networks that use a security protocol such as WPA. Third, they interfere with existing WiFi communication because they reflect their signal to another channel without implementing channel sensing. In this paper, we present WiTAG which addresses these problems, making the implementation and deployment of backscatter systems significantly more practical. In contrast with existing systems that build tags to communicate using the physical layer, we take a radically different approach by building tags that leverage features of the MAC layer to communicate. We design tags which can selectively interfere with subframes (MPDUs) in an aggregated frame (A-MPDU). This enables standard compliant communication using modern 802.11n and 802.11ac networks with minimal infrastructure and without requiring hardware or software modifications to any devices. The evaluation of our prototype system shows that with a client and an access point that are 8 meters apart, a tag can achieve data rates of 40 Kbps when located anywhere between the two devices.},
